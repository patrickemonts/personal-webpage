# PhD Position

We invite applications for a PhD position in the field quantum technology (computing, networking, simulation), to be advised by Patrick Emonts and co-advised by Joachim
Ankerhold. 
At the Institute for Complex Quantum Systems, you will find a welcoming, open, and highly interactive research environment. Our work is collaborative and interdisciplinary, spanning the fields of computer science, physics and math and it is firmly embedded in the international quantum computing and quantum technology community.

The topic of your PhD will lie at the exciting interface of *theoretical physics, quantum information theory, and computer science*, with the exact focus depending on your personal interests and background. 
If you are curious about the research directions that we pursue in our group, you can find more detailed information [here](/research).
