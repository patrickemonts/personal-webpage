# Postdoc Position

We invite applications for a postdoctoral position in the field of quantum many-body physics and quantum information at the Institute for Complex Quantum Systems, Ulm University. 

The research project of the postdoc will be in close collaboration with the Gärttner group in Jean and the group by Florian Meinert and Tilman Pfau in Stuttgart.
One of the focus aspects of the project is the development of new state preparation algorithms for quantum devices.
If you are curious about further research directions that we pursue in our group, you can find more detailed information [here](/research).
