I am a Junior Research Group Leader at the Institute for Complex Quantum Systems at Ulm University.
In the research group, we combine ideas from quantum information and many-body quantum physics.
The research is focused on numerical algorithms, especially tensor networks, and spans different fields ranging from quantum information to lattice gauge theories.

Additionally, I am a guest researcher in Leiden University, collaborating closely with the group for applied quantum algorithms (aQa).
