I am a Junior Research Group Leader at the Institute for Complex Quantum Systems at Ulm University.
My group is focuses on combining quantum information with many-body quantum physics.
My research is focused on numerical algorithms, especially tensor networks, and spans different fields ranging from quantum information to lattice gauge theories.

Additionally, I am a guest researcher in Leiden University, collaborating closely with the group for applied quantum algorithms (aQa).
