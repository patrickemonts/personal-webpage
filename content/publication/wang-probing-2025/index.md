abstract: Quantum nonlocality describes a stronger form of quantum correlation than
  that of entanglement. It refutes Einstein's belief of local realism and is among
  the most distinctive and enigmatic features of quantum mechanics. It is a crucial
  resource for achieving quantum advantages in a variety of practical applications,
  ranging from cryptography and certified random number generation via self-testing
  to machine learning. Nevertheless, the detection of nonlocality, especially in quantum
  many-body systems, is notoriously challenging. Here, we report an experimental certification
  of genuine multipartite Bell-operator correlations, which signal nonlocality in
  quantum many-body systems, up to 24 qubits with a fully programmable superconducting
  quantum processor. In particular, we employ energy as a Bell-operator correlation
  witness and variationally decrease the energy of a many-body system across a hierarchy
  of thresholds, below which an increasing Bell-operator correlation depth can be
  certified from experimental data. We variationally prepare the low-energy state
  of a two-dimensional honeycomb model with 73 qubits and certify its Bell-operator
  correlations by measuring an energy that surpasses the corresponding classical bound
  with up to 48 standard deviations. In addition, we variationally prepare a sequence
  of low-energy states and certify their genuine multipartite Bell-operator correlations
  up to 24 qubits via energies measured efficiently by parity oscillation and multiple
  quantum coherence techniques. Our results establish a viable approach for preparing
  and certifying multipartite Bell-operator correlations, which provide not only a
  finer benchmark beyond entanglement for quantum devices, but also a valuable guide
  toward exploiting multipartite Bell correlations in a wide spectrum of practical
  applications.
