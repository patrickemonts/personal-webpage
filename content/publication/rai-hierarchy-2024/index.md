abstract: Estimating spectral gaps of quantum many-body Hamiltonians is a highly challenging
  computational task, even under assumptions of locality and translation-invariance.
  Yet, the quest for rigorous gap certificates is motivated by their broad applicability,
  ranging from many-body physics to quantum computing and classical sampling techniques.
  Here we present a general method for obtaining lower bounds on the spectral gap
  of frustration-free quantum Hamiltonians in the thermodynamic limit. We formulate
  the gap certification problem as a hierarchy of optimization problems (semidefinite
  programs) in which the certificate -- a proof of a lower bound on the gap -- is
  improved with increasing levels. Our approach encompasses existing finite-size methods,
  such as Knabe's bound and its subsequent improvements, as those appear as particular
  possible solutions in our optimization, which is thus guaranteed to either match
  or surpass them. We demonstrate the power of the method on one-dimensional spin-chain
  models where we observe an improvement by several orders of magnitude over existing
  finite size criteria in both the accuracy of the lower bound on the gap, as well
  as the range of parameters in which a gap is detected.
