abstract: The antiferromagnetic Ising model on the pyrochlore lattice exhibits a quantum
  phase transition in an applied transverse field from the low-field quantum spin-ice
  phase to the high-field polarized regime. Recent field-theoretical analysis and
  series expansion results indicate this to be a discontinuous, first-order transition.
  Here, we explore this transition using quantum Monte Carlo simulations in order
  to assess this scenario and study the thermodynamic properties in the vicinity of
  the quantum phase transition. For this purpose, we also consider several variants
  of extended cluster-update schemes for the transverse-field Ising antiferromagnet
  on frustrated lattices and compare their performance to the conventional bond-based
  algorithm for the transverse-field Ising model on the pyrochlore lattice.
