abstract: Quantum teleportation is a concept that fascinates and confuses many people,
  in particular, given that it combines quantum physics and the concept of teleportation.
  With quantum teleportation likely to play a key role in several communication technologies
  and the quantum internet in the future, it is imperative to create learning tools
  and approaches that can accurately and effectively communicate the concept. Recent
  research has indicated the importance of teachers enthusing students about the topic
  of quantum physics. Therefore, educators at both high school and early university
  level need to find engaging and perhaps unorthodox ways of teaching complex, yet
  interesting topics such as quantum teleportation. In this paper, we present a paradigm
  to teach the concept of quantum teleportation using the Christmas gift-bringer Santa
  Claus. Using the example of Santa Claus, we use an unusual context to explore the
  key aspects of quantum teleportation, and all without being overly abstract. In
  addition, we outline a worksheet designed for use in the classroom setting which
  is based on common naive conceptions from quantum physics. This worksheet will be
  evaluated as a classroom resource to teach quantum teleportation in a subsequent
  study.
