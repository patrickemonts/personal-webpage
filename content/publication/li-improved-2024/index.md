abstract: Bell nonlocality is an intrinsic feature of quantum mechanics, which can
  be certified via the violation of Bell inequalities. It is therefore a fundamental
  question to certify Bell nonlocality from experimental data. Here, we present an
  optimization scheme to improve nonlocality certification by exploring flexible mappings
  between Bell inequalities and Hamiltonians corresponding to the Bell operators.
  We show that several Hamiltonian models can be mapped to new inequalities with improved
  classical bounds than the original one, enabling a more robust detection of nonlocality.
  From the other direction, we investigate the mapping from fixed Bell inequalities
  to Hamiltonians, aiming to maximize quantum violations while considering experimental
  imperfections. As a practical demonstration, we apply this method to an XXZ-like
  honeycomb-lattice model utilizing over 70 superconducting qubits. The successful
  application of this technique, as well as combining the two directions to form an
  optimization loop, may open new avenues for developing more practical and noise-resilient
  nonlocality certification techniques and enable broader experimental explorations.
