abstract: Bell nonlocality provides a robust scalable route to the efficient certification
  of quantum states. Here, we introduce a general framework for constructing Bell
  inequalities tailored to the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code
  for odd prime local dimensions. Selecting a suitable subset of stabilizer operators
  and mapping them to generalized measurement observables, we compute multipartite
  Bell expressions whose quantum maxima admit a sum-of-squares decomposition. We show
  that these inequalities are maximally violated by all states in the ground-state
  manifold of the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code, and determine
  their classical (local) bounds through a combination of combinatorial tiling arguments
  and explicit optimization. As a concrete application, we analyze the case of $d=3$
  and demonstrate that the maximal violation self-tests the full qutrit toric-code
  subspace, up to local isometries and complex conjugation. This constitutes, to our
  knowledge, the first-ever example of self-testing a qutrit subspace. Extending these
  constructions, we further present schemes to enhance the ratio of classical--quantum
  bounds and thus improve robustness to experimental imperfections. Our results establish
  a pathway toward device-independent certification of highly entangled topological
  quantum matter and provide new tools for validating qudit states in error-correcting
  codes and quantum simulation platforms.
