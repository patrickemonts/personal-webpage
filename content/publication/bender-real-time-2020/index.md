abstract: We introduce a class of variational states to study ground-state properties
  and real-time dynamics in (2 + 1)-dimensional compact QED. These are based on complex
  Gaussian states which are made periodic to account for the compact nature of the
  U (1) gauge field. Since the evaluation of expectation values involves infinite
  sums, we present an approximation scheme for the whole variational manifold. We
  calculate the ground-state energy density for lattice sizes up to 20 Ã— 20 and extrapolate
  to the thermodynamic limit for the whole coupling region. Additionally, we study
  the string tension both by fitting the potential between two static charges and
  by fitting the exponential decay of spatial Wilson loops. As the ansatz does not
  require a truncation in the local Hilbert spaces, we analyze truncation effects
  which are present in other approaches. The variational states are benchmarked against
  exact solutions known for the one plaquette case and exact diagonalization results
  for a Z3 lattice gauge theory. Using the time-dependent variational principle, we
  study real-time dynamics after various global quenches, e.g., the time evolution
  of a strongly confined electric field between two charges after a quench to the
  weak-coupling regime. Up to the points where finite-size effects start to play a
  role, we observe equilibrating behavior.
