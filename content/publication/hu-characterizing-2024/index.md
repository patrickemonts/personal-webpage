abstract: 'Nonlocality is one of the key features of quantum physics, which is revealed
  through the violation of a Bell inequality. In large multipartite systems, nonlocality
  characterization quickly becomes a challenging task. A common practice is to make
  use of symmetries, low-order correlators, or exploiting local geometries, to restrict
  the class of inequalities. In this paper, we characterize translation-invariant
  (TI) Bell inequalities with finite-range correlators in one-dimensional geometries.
  We introduce a novel methodology based on tropical algebra tensor networks and highlight
  its connection to graph theory. Surprisingly, we find that the TI Bell polytope
  has a number of extremal points that can be uniformly upper-bounded with respect
  to the system size. We give an efficient method to list all vertices of the polytope
  for a particular system size, and characterize the tightness of a given TI Bell
  inequality. The connections highlighted in our work allow us to re-interpret concepts
  developed in the fields of tropical algebra and graph theory in the context of Bell
  nonlocality, and vice-versa. This work extends a parallel article [M. Hu textitet
  al., arXiv: 2208.02798 (2022)] on the same subject.'
