abstract: Entanglement is the fundamental difference between classical and quantum
  systems and has become one of the guiding principles in the exploration of high-
  and low-energy physics. The calculation of entanglement entropies in interacting
  quantum field theories, however, remains challenging. Here, we present the first
  method for the explicit computation of reduced density matrices of interacting quantum
  field theories using truncated Hamiltonian methods. The method is based on constructing
  an isomorphism between the Hilbert space of the full system and the tensor product
  of Hilbert spaces of subintervals. This naturally enables the computation of the
  von Neumann and arbitrary RÃ©nyi entanglement entropies as well as mutual information,
  logarithmic negativity, and other measures of entanglement. Our method is applicable
  to equilibrium states and nonequilibrium evolution in real time. It is model independent
  and can be applied to any Hamiltonian truncation method that uses a free basis expansion.
  We benchmark the method on the free Klein-Gordon theory finding excellent agreement
  with the analytic results. We further demonstrate its potential on the interacting
  sine-Gordon model, studying the scaling of von Neumann entropy in ground states
  and real-time dynamics following quenches of the model.
