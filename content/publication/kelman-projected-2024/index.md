abstract: Lattice gauge theory is an important framework for studying gauge theories
  that arise in the Standard Model and condensed matter physics. Yet many systems
  (or regimes of those systems) are difficult to study using conventional techniques,
  such as action-based Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, we demonstrate the use
  of gauged Gaussian projected entangled pair states as an ansatz for a lattice gauge
  theory involving dynamical physical matter. We study a $mathbbZ_2$ gauge theory
  on a two dimensional lattice with a single flavor of fermionic matter on each lattice
  site. Our results show agreement with results computed by exactly diagonalizing
  the Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the approach is computationally feasible for
  larger system sizes where exact results are unavailable. This is a further step
  on the road to studying higher dimensions and other gauge groups with manageable
  computational costs while avoiding the sign problem.
