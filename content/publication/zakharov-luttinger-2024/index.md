abstract: 'To apply the powerful many-body techniques of tensor networks to massless
  Dirac fermions one wants to discretize the $pḑotsigma$ Hamiltonian and construct
  a matrix-product-operator (MPO) representation. We compare two alternative discretization
  schemes, one with a sine dispersion, the other with a tangent dispersion, applied
  to a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid with Hubbard interaction. Both types of lattice
  fermions allow for an exact MPO representation of low bond dimension, so they are
  efficiently computable, but only the tangent dispersion gives a power law decay
  of the propagator in agreement with the continuum limit: The sine dispersion is
  gapped by the interactions, evidenced by an exponentially decaying propagator. Our
  construction of a tensor network with an unpaired Dirac cone works around the fermion-doubling
  obstruction by exploiting the fact that the textitnonlocal Hamiltonian of tangent
  fermions permits a textitlocal generalized eigenproblem.'
