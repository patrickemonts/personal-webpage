abstract: Classical simulation of quantum physics is a central approach to investigating
  physical phenomena. Quantum computers enhance computational capabilities beyond
  those of classical resources, but it remains unclear to what extent existing limited
  quantum computers can contribute to this enhancement. In this work, we explore a
  new hybrid, efficient quantum-classical representation of quantum states, the multiple-basis
  representation. This representation consists of a linear combination of states that
  are sparse in some given and different bases, specified by quantum circuits. Such
  representation is particularly appealing when considering depth-limited quantum
  circuits within reach of current hardware. We analyze the expressivity of multiple-basis
  representation states depending on the classical simulability of their quantum circuits.
  In particular, we show that multiple-basis representation states include, but are
  not restricted to, both matrix-product states and stabilizer states. Furthermore,
  we find cases in which this representation can be used, namely approximation of
  ground states, simulation of deeper computations by specifying bases with shallow
  circuits, and a tomographical protocol to describe states as multiple-basis representations.
  We envision this work to open the path of simultaneous use of several hardware-friendly
  bases, a natural description of hybrid computational methods accessible for near-term
  hardware.
