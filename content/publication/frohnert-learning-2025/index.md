abstract: Matching theoretical predictions to experimental data remains a central
  challenge in hadron spectroscopy. In particular, the identification of new hadronic
  states is difficult, as exotic signals near threshold can arise from a variety of
  physical mechanisms. A key diagnostic in this context is the pole structure of the
  scattering amplitude, but different configurations can produce similar signatures.
  The mapping between pole configurations and line shapes is especially ambiguous
  near the mass threshold, where analytic control is limited. In this work, we introduce
  an uncertainty-aware machine learning approach for classifying pole structures in
  $S$-matrix elements. Our method is based on an ensemble of classifier chains that
  provide both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates. We apply a rejection
  criterion based on predictive uncertainty, achieving a validation accuracy of nearly
  $95%$ while discarding only a small fraction of high-uncertainty predictions. Trained
  on synthetic data with known pole structures, the model generalizes to previously
  unseen experimental data, including enhancements associated with the $P_̧baŗ(4312)textasciicircum+$
  state observed by LHCb. In this, we infer a four-pole structure, representing the
  presence of a genuine compact pentaquark in the presence of a higher channel virtual
  state pole with non-vanishing width. While evaluated on this particular state, our
  framework is broadly applicable to other candidate hadronic states and offers a
  scalable tool for pole structure inference in scattering amplitudes.
