abstract: Bell nonlocality is the resource that enables device-independent quantum
  information processing tasks. It is revealed through the violation of so-called
  Bell inequalities, indicating that the observed correlations cannot be reproduced
  by any local hidden variable model. While well explored in few-body settings, the
  question of which Bell inequalities are best suited for a given task remains quite
  open in the many-body scenario. One natural approach is to assign Bell inequalities
  to physical Hamiltonians, mapping their interaction graph to two-body, nearest-neighbor
  terms. Here, we investigate the effect of boundary conditions in a two-dimensional
  square lattice, which can induce different topologies in lattice systems. We find
  a relation between the induced topology and the Bell inequality's effectiveness
  in revealing nonlocal correlations. By using a combination of tropical algebra and
  tensor networks, we quantify their detection capacity for nonlocality. Our work
  can act as a guide to certify Bell nonlocality in many-qubit devices by choosing
  a suitable Hamiltonian and measuring its ground state energy; a task that many quantum
  experiments are purposely built for.
