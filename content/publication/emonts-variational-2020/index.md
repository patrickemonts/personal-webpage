abstract: Variational minimization of tensor network states enables the exploration
  of low energy states of lattice gauge theories. However, the exact numerical evaluation
  of high-dimensional tensor network states remains challenging in general. In [E.
  Zohar and J. I. Cirac, Phys. Rev. D 97, 034510 (2018)] it was shown how, by combining
  gauged Gaussian projected entangled pair states with a variational Monte Carlo procedure,
  it is possible to efficiently compute physical observables. In this paper we demonstrate
  how this approach can be used to investigate numerically the ground state of a lattice
  gauge theory. More concretely, we explicitly carry out the variational Monte Carlo
  procedure based on such contraction methods for a pure gauge KogutSusskind Hamiltonian
  with a Z3 gauge field in two spatial dimensions. This is a first proof of principle
  to the method, which provides an inherent way to increase the number of variational
  parameters and can be readily extended to systems with physical fermions.
