abstract: Quantum nonlocality describes a stronger form of quantum correlation than
  that of entanglement. It refutes Einstein's belief of local realism and is among
  the most distinctive and enigmatic features of quantum mechanics. It is a crucial
  resource for achieving quantum advantages in a variety of practical applications,
  ranging from cryptography and certified random number generation via self-testing
  to machine learning. Nevertheless, the detection of nonlocality, especially in quantum
  many-body systems, is notoriously challenging. Here, we report an experimental certification
  of genuine multipartite Bell correlations, which signal nonlocality in quantum many-body
  systems, up to 24 qubits with a fully programmable superconducting quantum processor.
  In particular, we employ energy as a Bell correlation witness and variationally
  decrease the energy of a many-body system across a hierarchy of thresholds, below
  which an increasing Bell correlation depth can be certified from experimental data.
  As an illustrating example, we variationally prepare the low-energy state of a two-dimensional
  honeycomb model with 73 qubits and certify its Bell correlations by measuring an
  energy that surpasses the corresponding classical bound with up to 48 standard deviations.
  In addition, we variationally prepare a sequence of low-energy states and certify
  their genuine multipartite Bell correlations up to 24 qubits via energies measured
  efficiently by parity oscillation and multiple quantum coherence techniques. Our
  results establish a viable approach for preparing and certifying multipartite Bell
  correlations, which provide not only a finer benchmark beyond entanglement for quantum
  devices, but also a valuable guide towards exploiting multipartite Bell correlation
  in a wide spectrum of practical applications.
