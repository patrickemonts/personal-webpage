abstract: The preparation of nontrivial states is crucial to the study of quantum
  many-body physics. Such states can be prepared with adiabatic quantum algorithms,
  which are restricted by the minimum spectral gap along the path. In this Letter,
  we propose an efficient method to adiabatically prepare tensor network states (TNSs).
  We maximize the spectral gap leveraging degrees of freedom in the parent Hamiltonian
  construction. We demonstrate this efficient adiabatic algorithm for preparing TNSs,
  through examples of random TNSs in one dimension, AKLT (Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki),
  and GHZ states. The Hamiltonian optimization applies to both injective and non-injective
  tensors, in the latter case by exploiting symmetries present in the tensors.
