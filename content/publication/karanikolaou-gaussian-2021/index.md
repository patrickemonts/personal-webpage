abstract: Tensor networks states allow one to find the low-energy states of local
  lattice Hamiltonians through variational optimization. Recently, a construction
  of such states in the continuum was put forward, providing a first step towards
  the goal of solving quantum field theories (QFTs) variationally. However, the proposed
  manifold of continuous tensor network states (CTNSs) is difficult to study in full
  generality, because the expectation values of local observables cannot be computed
  analytically. In this paper we study a tractable subclass of CTNSs, the Gaussian
  CTNSs (GCTNSs), and benchmark them on simple quadratic and quartic bosonic QFT Hamiltonians.
  We show that GCTNSs provide arbitrarily accurate approximations to the ground states
  of quadratic Hamiltonians and decent estimates for quartic ones at weak coupling.
  Since they capture the short distance behavior of the theories we consider exactly,
  GCTNSs even allow one to renormalize away simple divergences variationally. In the
  end our study makes it plausible that CTNSs are indeed a good manifold to approximate
  the low-energy states of QFTs.
