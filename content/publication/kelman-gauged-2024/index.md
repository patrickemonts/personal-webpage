abstract: Gauge theories form the basis of our understanding of modern physics - ranging
  from the description of quarks and gluons to effective models in condensed matter
  physics. In the non-perturbative regime, gauge theories are conventionally treated
  discretely as lattice gauge theories. The resulting systems are evaluated with path-integral
  based Monte Carlo methods. These methods, however, can suffer from the sign problem
  and do not allow for a direct evaluation of real-time dynamics. In this work, we
  present a unified and comprehensive framework for gauged Gaussian Projected Entangled
  Pair States (PEPS), a variational ansatz based on tensor networks. We review the
  construction of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories, explain their similarities with
  PEPS, and detail the construction of the state. The estimation of ground states
  is based on a variational Monte Carlo procedure with the PEPS as an ansatz state.
  This sign-problem-free ansatz can be efficiently evaluated in any dimension with
  arbitrary gauge groups, and can include dynamical fermionic matter, suggesting new
  options for the simulation of non-perturbative regimes of gauge theories, including
  QCD.
