abstract: Gauge theories form the basis of our understanding of modern physics---ranging
  from the description of quarks and gluons to effective models in condensed matter
  physics. In the nonperturbative regime, gauge theories are conventionally treated
  discretely as lattice gauge theories. The resulting systems are evaluated with path-integral
  based Monte Carlo methods. These methods, however, can suffer from the sign problem
  and do not allow for a direct evaluation of real-time dynamics. In this work, we
  present a unified and comprehensive framework for gauged Gaussian projected entangled
  pair states (PEPS), a variational ansatz based on tensor networks. We review the
  construction of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories, explain their similarities to
  PEPS, and detail the construction of the ansatz state. The estimation of ground
  states is based on a variational Monte Carlo procedure with the PEPS as an ansatz
  state. This sign-problem-free ansatz can be efficiently evaluated in any dimension
  with arbitrary gauge groups, and can include dynamical fermionic matter, suggesting
  new options for the simulation of nonperturbative regimes of gauge theories, including
  quantum chromodynamics.
