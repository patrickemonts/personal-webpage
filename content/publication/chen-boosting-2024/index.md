abstract: Understanding and optimizing the relaxation dynamics of many-body systems
  is essential for both foundational studies in quantum thermodynamics, as well as
  for applications including quantum simulation and quantum computing. Efficient thermal
  state preparation of a given many-body Hamiltonian depends on the spectrum of Lindbladian
  defined via jump operators. In this work we provide a systematic framework allowing
  construction of an optimal Lindbladian resulting in fast thermal state preparation
  for a considered Hamiltonian. Importantly, the optimal Lindbladian respects the
  symmetries of the target equilibrium state. We demonstrate the potential of our
  framework and optimization with the kinetic Ising model and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick
  model, showcasing efficient thermal state preparation.
