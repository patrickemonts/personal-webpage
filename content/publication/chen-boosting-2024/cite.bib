 abstract = {Understanding and optimizing the relaxation dynamics of many-body systems is essential for both foundational studies in quantum thermodynamics, as well as for applications including quantum simulation and quantum computing. Efficient thermal state preparation of a given many-body Hamiltonian depends on the spectrum of Lindbladian defined via jump operators. In this work we provide a systematic framework allowing construction of an optimal Lindbladian resulting in fast thermal state preparation for a considered Hamiltonian. Importantly, the optimal Lindbladian respects the symmetries of the target equilibrium state. We demonstrate the potential of our framework and optimization with the kinetic Ising model and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, showcasing efficient thermal state preparation.},
