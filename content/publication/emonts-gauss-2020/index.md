abstract: 'In these lecture notes, we review some recent works on Hamiltonian lattice
  gauge theories, that involve, in particular, tensor network methods. The results
  reviewed here are tailored together in a slightly different way from the one used
  in the contexts where they were first introduced. We look at the Gauss law from
  two different points of view: for the gauge field, it is a differential equation,
  while from  the matter point of view, on the other hand, it is a simple, explicit
  algebraic equation.  We will review and discuss what these two points of view allow
  and do not allow us to do, in terms of unitarily gauging a pure-matter theory and
  eliminating the matter from a gauge theory, and relate that to the construction
  of PEPS (Projected Entangled Pair States) for lattice gauge theories.'
