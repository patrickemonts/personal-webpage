abstract: Fermionic Gaussian Projected Entangled Pair States are fermionic tensor
  network state constructions which describe the physics of ground states of non-interacting
  fermionic Hamiltonians. As non-interacting states, one may study and analyze them
  very efficiently, in both analytical and numerical means. Recently it was shown
  that they may be used as the starting point - after applying so-called PEPS gauging
  mechanisms - for variational study of lattice gauge theories. This is done using
  sign-problem free variational Monte-Carlo. In this work we show how to generalize
  such states from two to three spatial dimensions, focusing on spin representations
  and requirements of lattice rotations. We present constructions which are crucial
  for the application of the above mentioned variational Monte-Carlo techniques for
  studying non-perturbative lattice gauge theory physics, with fermionic matter, in
  $2+1$-d and $3+1$-d models. Thus, the constructions presented here are crucial for
  the study of non-trivial lattice gauge theories with fermionic tensor network states.
